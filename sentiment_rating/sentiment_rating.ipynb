    "At a high level, neural networks encoded encode some input variables via a set of parameters (weights) that are optimized to predict some output variable. The simplest type of neural network is a feed-forward multilayer perceptron (MLP) which operates on some feature representation of a linguistic input. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are an extension of this simple model that specifically model the sequential aspect of the input and thus are particularly useful for natural language processing tasks. The notebook demonstrates the code needed to assemble MLP and RNN models for an NLP task using the Keras library, as well as some data processing tools that facilitate building the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you understand how to structure the input and output of the model, and know the fundamental concepts in machine learning, then a high-level understanding of how a neural network works is sufficient for using Keras. You'll see that most of the code here is actually just data manipulation, and I'll visualize each step in this process. The code used to assemble the models themselves is more minimal. It is of course useful to know these details, so you can theorize on the results and innovate the model to make it better. For a better understanding of neural networks and RNNs in particular, see the resources at the bottom of the notebook.\n",

    "Here a neural network will be used to encode the text of a movie review, and this representation will be used to predict the numerical rating assigned by the reviewer. The model shown here can be applied to any task where the goal is to predict a numerical score associated with a piece of text. Hopefully you can substitute your own datasets and/or modify the code to adapt it to other tasks.\n",

Unlike an RNN, an MLP model is not a sequence model - it represents data as a flat matrix of features rather than a time-ordered sequence of features. For language data, this generally means that the word order of a sequence will not be explicitly encoded into a model. The importance of word order varies for different NLP tasks; in some cases, order-sensitive approaches do not necessarily perform better.\n",

The value for each dimension is the number of times the word corresponding to that dimension appears in the text. Thus a dataset of text sequences is encoded as a matrix where each row represents a sequence and each column represents a word whose value is the frequency of that word in the sequence (it is also common to apply some weighting function to these values such as [tf-idf](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tf-idf-weighting-1.html), but here we'll just use counts).\n",

For the MLP model, including this dimension won't make a difference because the model will learn to ignore it in making predictions."

A model consists of a series of layers. As shown in the code below, we initialize instances for each layer. Each layer can be called with another layer as input, e.g. Dense()(input_layer).

One huge benefit of Keras is that it implements many of these details for you.

The advantage of this representation over the standard bag-of-words representation is that it more explicitly represents the meaning of the words in the review. For example, two reviews may express similar content (and have similar ratings) but may vary in the exact words they use, so their continous bag-of-word vectors may be more similar than their standard bag-of-words vectors.

This enables the model to process multiple sequences in parallel (batches) as opposed to one at a time. Using batches significantly speeds up training. However, each review has a different number of words, so we create a padded matrix equal to the length on the longest review in the training set.

    "Yoav Goldberg's book [Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing](http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00762ED1V01Y201703HLT037) is a thorough introduction to neural networks for NLP tasks in general.\n",

    "If you'd like to learn more about what Keras is doing under the hood, there is a [Theano tutorial](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html) that also applies an RNN to sentiment prediction, using the same dataset here\n",
    "\n",
    "Andrej Karpathy's blog post [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) is very helpful for understanding the mathematical details of an RNN, applied to the task of language modeling. It also provides raw Python code with an implementation of the backpropagation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow also has an RNN language model [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/tutorials/recurrent/index.html) using the Penn Treebank dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Chris Olah provides a good [explanation](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) of how LSTM RNNs work (this explanation also applies to the GRU model used here)\n",
    "\n",
    "Denny Britz's [tutorial](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/) documents well both the technical details of RNNs and their implementation in Python."
